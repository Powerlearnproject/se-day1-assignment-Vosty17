#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software.
It's importance in technology industry 
Managing Complexity: Modern systems (e.g., AI platforms, cloud infrastructure) are inherently complex. Software engineering breaks down problems into manageable components, enabling scalable solutions.

Collaboration and Teamwork: Tools like version control (e.g., Git) and project management platforms (e.g., Jira) streamline coordination among global, cross-functional teams.
Cost and Time Efficiency: Structured processes reduce rework, minimize delays, and optimize resource allocation, critical for meeting budgets and deadlines.

Quality and Reliability: Automated testing, continuous integration, and adherence to standards (e.g., ISO/IEC) ensure high-quality outputs, reducing failures in critical sectors like healthcare or aviation.

Security: Best practices in secure coding, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments protect against cyber threats, vital in an era of escalating digital risks
Innovation Enablement: By streamlining development, engineers focus on creative solutions, driving advancements in AI, IoT, and blockchain.

Economic Impact: The tech industry’s growth—from startups to giants like Google—relies on efficient software engineering to deliver competitive products and services.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1.The Agile Manifesto 2001
 -Traditional methodologies like Waterfall were rigid, slow, and struggled to adapt to changing  In 2001, 17 software developers published the Agile Manifesto, prioritizing:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
Working software over comprehensive documentation.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
Responding to change over following a plan.
2.The Rise of DevOps and Continuous Delivery As software systems grew more complex, silos between development and operations teams caused delays, bugs, and deployment failures. The emergence of DevOps (Development + Operations) in the late 2000s introduced tools and practices like:

Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Automating code integration, testing, and deployment.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing infrastructure via code (e.g., Terraform, Kubernetes).

Cloud Computing: Scalable, on-demand resources (AWS,
To Bridged the gap between developers and IT operations, enabling rapid, reliable releases.

Reduced deployment cycles from months to minutes.

Supported the rise of microservices, cloud-native apps, and modern tech
3.The 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering in Garmisch, Germany, formally coined the term software engineering to advocate for applying systematic, disciplined engineering principles to software development.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.1.Planning Phase- Define the project scope, goals, and feasibility.
Conduct feasibility studies (technical, operational, financial).
Identify risks and resource requirements.
Create a project plan (timeline, budget, team roles).
2.Requirements Analysis Phase-Gather and document stakeholder needs.
Interview stakeholders, conduct workshops, and analyze business processes.Define functional and non-functional requirements.
Deliverable: Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
3.Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user 
functional requirements.
 4. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
 5.Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and 
 6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after

specifications.
 7. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design 
deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.Structure: Waterfall is linear vs. Agile’s iterative cycles.
Change Management: Waterfall resists changes post-phase vs. Agile embraces changes.
Timeline: Waterfall has fixed phases vs. Agile’s time-boxed sprints.
Communication: Waterfall relies on formal documentation vs. Agile’s face-to-face collaboration
Scenario 
a)Developing software for a medical device requiring FDA approval.Regulatory compliance demands rigorous documentation and phase-by-phase sign-offs. Changes post-design could invalidate compliance, making Waterfall’s structured approach essential.
(b)Another Example: A government infrastructure project (e.g., a bridge) with fixed specifications and budget.Clear, unchanging requirements and the need for precise engineering plans align with Waterfall’s phase-gated process.
2Agile Appropriate Example

Scenario: A startup building a social media app in a competitive market.
Rapid user feedback and the need to pivot features (e.g., adding Stories or Reels) make Agile’s iterative releases ideal.

Another Example: A corporate team developing an internal project management tool.
Stakeholders may request frequent adjustments based on evolving workflow needs, which Agile accommodates through

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of a person
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
